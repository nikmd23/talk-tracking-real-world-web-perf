Tracking Real World Web Performance
===================================

Abstract
--------

> Study upon study confirms that web performance has a direct correlation to revenue, operating costs, and search engine ranking. With this in mind, we all want our applications to be faster but how do we know what bottlenecks to focus on?

> Join Nik Molnar, co-founder of the open source debugging and diagnostics tool Glimpse, to learn how to leverage free and open source tools to capture your application’s live performance data, understand what the metrics mean and focus on the ones you should really care about.

> This session will cover how to use free services to act as a simple lab for synthetic performance testing and how to get Real User Metrics (RUM) from the very last mile via the instrumentation API’s built into browsers. Nik will also demonstrate techniques to automate the performance feedback loop so you can ensure to always treat “fast as a feature”.

> This session is suitable for any stakeholder who cares about performance. It is classified as 200 level.
